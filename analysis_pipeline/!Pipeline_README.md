# Pipeline README

This folder contains all code necessary to get the results and figures presented in Kline et al (PREPRINT) from (1) behavioral data collected during the study and (2) the output of all second-level analyses (which are lab-standardized and unmodified for this experiment, though see note on transition from old to new PL2017 preprocessing pipeline.)  This includes data from *both* experiments, though note that data from E1 comes pre-tidied (can be reproduced from separate repo - [https://github.com/mekline/Jokes-Analysis](https://github.com/mekline/Jokes-Analysis) - if you really want.)

The analyses conducted in this repo can all be reproduced from this raw data (& were conducted on my laptop, not mindhive), but for sanity we also provide the Rdataframe with NAMED ROIs and conditions!
