# Pipeline README

This folder contains all code necessary to get the results and figures presented in Kline et al (PREPRINT) from (1) behavioral data collected during the study and (2) the output of all second-level analyses (which are lab-standardized and unmodified for this experiment, though see note on transition from old to new PL2017 preprocessing pipeline) 

The analyses conducted in this repo can all be reproduced from this set of data (& were conducted on my laptop, not mindhive)
