Readme for Jokes behavioral files

These are generated by the code for the jokes experiment (see Materials). Melissa occasionally made mistakes/typos either naming the participant or entering script parameters, AND it wasn't transparent to me how parameters corresponded to condition timing for modeling, so it's a little messy in here. To double check everything, parameter_unfolding.csv has the params that were run according to the session record sheet, but then we use the actual datafiles produced by the script to make para files for each participant (we do this anyway for the custom/rated version of the jokes analysis). 

Outputs_unused/ is the directory where any data files generated that are not actually from runs analyzed for MRI are stored

As part of the above error, many participants were run in a mix of the two lists, which means that they were exposed to both the joke and nonjoke version of some items (which should not happen by design).  UPDATE: THIS IS WRONG! The script produces a set of materials on the first run, then uses those materials for any remaining runs with the same ID code, so weâ€™re fine! 

Files produced here are then exported back to mindhive for first-level analysis/modeling with condition timing from the new para files.
