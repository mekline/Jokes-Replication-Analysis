Readme for Jokes behavioral files

These are generated by the code for the jokes experiment (see Materials). Melissa occasionally made mistakes/typos either naming the participant or entering script parameters, AND it wasn't transparent to me how parameters corresponded to condition timing for modeling, so it's a little messy in here. To double check everything, parameter_unfolding.csv has the params that were run according to the session record sheet, and corresponding para files that should be used (for 'standard' parafiles.)

Outputs_unused/ is the directory where any data files generated that are not actually from runs analyzed for MRI are stored

As part of the above error, many participants were run in a mix of the two lists, which means that they were exposed to both the joke and nonjoke version of some items (which should not happen by design).  To deal with this & make sure we get it right, there's a python script called <NAME> to take in the raw data and then print out subject-specific para & cat files to use for the final modeling.  There are 2 versions of these: one with all items included, and one where the second instance of any repeated item is modeled as an OTHER condition. 

Files produced here are then exported back to mindhive for first-level analysis/modeling with condition timing from the new para files.
